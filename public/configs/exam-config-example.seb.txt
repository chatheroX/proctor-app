# ZenTest - Safe Exam Browser (SEB) Configuration Example
# Last Updated: [Date of last update to this example text file]

# This file provides INSTRUCTIONS and EXAMPLES for configuring your ACTUAL `exam-config.seb` file
# using the official SEB Configuration Tool (available from safeexambrowser.org).
# You MUST create your `exam-config.seb` with the tool and place it in your project's
# `public/configs/exam-config.seb` directory.

# ZenTest's web application NO LONGER forces a download of this .seb file during exam launch.
# Instead, it launches SEB directly to a specific secure entry URL within the application:
#   `sebs://YOUR_APP_DOMAIN/seb/entry/[GENERATED_TOKEN]`
#
# This means the settings below are RECOMMENDATIONS for how students/institutions
# should configure their SEB client *before* navigating to ZenTest to take an exam,
# to ensure the highest level of security. ZenTest's in-app pages (`/seb/*`) will
# perform JavaScript-based checks, but a well-configured SEB client provides deeper OS-level security.

# --- CRITICAL: Start URL (if user starts SEB manually with this config) ---
# If a student starts SEB by manually opening this .seb file (or an institution deploys it),
# this Start URL will be used. It should point to your application's main student login or exam joining page.
# Replace `YOUR_APP_DOMAIN` with your actual deployed application domain (e.g., https://proctorx.netlify.app).
#
# Example Start URL (for manual SEB launch):
# startURL = https://YOUR_APP_DOMAIN/auth
# OR
# startURL = https://YOUR_APP_DOMAIN/student/dashboard/join-exam

# --- General Settings ---
# examSessionClearCookiesOnEnd = True
# examSessionClearCookiesOnStart = True
# showTaskBar = False
# showReloadButton = True  (Consider carefully - app has no in-exam reload button)
# showTime = True
# allowPreferencesWindow = False (For exam takers)
# allowQuit = True (Controls if the quit button in SEB UI is enabled; app can still force quit via seb://quit)

# --- Browser Exam Key & Config Key (For validating SEB client settings against a server - Advanced) ---
# If you use an SEB Server or a Learning Management System that supports SEB keys:
# browserExamKey = [Generate a unique key]
# configKey = [Generate a unique key, derived from browserExamKey and Start URL]
# sendBrowserExamKey = True
# These are crucial for verifying the integrity of the SEB environment if your backend supports it.
# ZenTest's current client-side JavaScript checks are a supplement/alternative if SEB Server is not used.

# --- Security Settings ---
# allowDeveloperConsole = False
# allowVirtualMachine = False (Or "Detect and Quit")
# allowScreenCapture = False
# allowAudioCapture = False (If not needed for your exam type)
# enableSafeMode = True (If applicable for your SEB version/OS)

# --- Allowed/Prohibited Processes ---
# List any applications that are explicitly allowed or prohibited.
# Example:
# prohibitedProcesses = [
#   {
#     "executable": "TeamViewer.exe",
#     "originalName": "TeamViewer.exe",
#     "description": "Remote Desktop"
#   },
#   {
#     "executable": "Discord.exe",
#     "description": "Communication App"
#   }
# ]

# --- Keyboard Shortcuts ---
# allow préférencesWindow = False (To prevent users from changing SEB settings)
# allowDeveloperConsole = False
# allowPageInspect = False
# enableEsc = False (Or only allow seb://quit)
# enableCtrlN = False (New Window)
# enableCtrlR = False (Reload - SEB's reload button can be used if enabled)
# enableCtrlTab = False (Switch Tabs)
# ... and other shortcuts (F1-F12, Alt+Tab, Cmd+C, Cmd+V etc.) should be disabled.
# SEB usually has profiles for this ("Disable All Function Keys", etc.)

# --- URL Filtering (If needed, though token auth reduces direct need for complex filters) ---
# This can restrict SEB to only navigate to your application's domain.
# Example:
# urlFilterRules = [
#   { "expression": "https://YOUR_APP_DOMAIN/*", "action": "allow" },
#   { "expression": "*", "action": "block" } // Block everything else
# ]

# --- Browser Window ---
# newBrowserWindowByLinkPolicy = 2 (Block links opening new windows, or configure as needed)
# newBrowserWindowByScriptPolicy = 2 (Block scripts opening new windows)

# --- Quit Link ---
# quitURL = seb://quit (Ensures the "Exit SEB" buttons in your app work)

# --- Remember ---
# This `.seb.txt` file is a TEMPLATE/GUIDE.
# You must use the SEB Configuration Tool to create the actual `exam-config.seb` file.
# Place the final `exam-config.seb` in `public/configs/exam-config.seb` in your project.
# However, for the CURRENT ZenTest flow (launching directly to /seb/entry/[token]), this external
# .seb file is primarily for users/institutions to pre-configure their SEB for enhanced security.
# The application does not force its download at exam launch anymore.
# The critical "Start URL" for the app-initiated flow is what the app launches SEB with.
# The "Start URL" inside THIS .seb file is for when SEB is started by opening THIS .seb file directly.
