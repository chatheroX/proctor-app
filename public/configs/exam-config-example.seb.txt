This is an example of settings you should configure in your ACTUAL `exam-config.seb` file
using the Safe Exam Browser (SEB) Configuration Tool.

**CRITICAL SETTINGS:**

1.  **Start URL**:
    *   Set this to: `https://YOUR_APP_DOMAIN/seb/exam-view`
    *   Replace `YOUR_APP_DOMAIN` with your actual deployed application domain (e.g., `https://proctorx.netlify.app`).
    *   **DO NOT include `#examId=...` or `&token=...` here in the SEB Config Tool.**
    *   The `examId` and `token` will be passed as part of the hash in the `configUrl` when SEB is launched from your web application. The `/seb/exam-view` page in your app is designed to read these from `window.location.hash`.

2.  **Permitted Processes/Applications**:
    *   Generally, block all other applications. Allow only SEB and its subprocesses.

3.  **Browser Exam Key (BEK) & Config Key (CK)**:
    *   Generate and use strong BrowserExamKey and ConfigKey if your exam platform (your Next.js app's /seb/exam-view page) is set up to validate them. (Currently, our client-side code does not explicitly validate these, but it's good practice for higher security).
    *   If not validating them, these keys are less critical for the immediate flow but should still be set in the SEB config.

4.  **URL Filter**:
    *   Enable the URL filter.
    *   Allow access to: `https://YOUR_APP_DOMAIN/*` (replace with your domain).
    *   Potentially allow access to `https://api.dicebear.com/*` if you are loading avatars from there directly within the SEB exam interface (though typically avatars would be loaded before the exam starts or passed as data).
    *   Block all other URLs by default.

5.  **Security Options**:
    *   **Enable General Security**:
        *   Disable screen capture.
        *   Disable printing.
        *   Disable "magic" F11 key.
    *   **Enable Browser Security**:
        *   Block plug-ins (Flash, Java, Silverlight).
        *   Block Java applets.
        *   Block JavaScript `window.open` and `window.close` if not strictly needed by your exam interface (SEB handles its own window).
        *   Block pop-up windows.
        *   Disable developer tools.
    *   **Enable Kiosk Mode**:
        *   Choose an appropriate kiosk mode (e.g., "Disable Explorer Shell" or "Create New Desktop").
        *   Prevent quitting SEB (allow quit link `seb://quit` which will be triggered by your app).
        *   Disable Ctrl+Alt+Del.
        *   Disable Alt+Tab / Cmd+Tab.
        *   Disable other function keys (F1-F12) as needed.
    *   **Enable Applications**:
        *   Prevent starting prohibited applications.
        *   Prevent switching to prohibited applications.
    *   **Enable Network**:
        *   Configure allowed network interfaces if necessary (usually not needed).

6.  **User Interface Options**:
    *   Show SEB taskbar: Optional, can be hidden for a more immersive experience.
    *   Enable "Quit" button: Set to show the quit button or use a quit link. Your application will trigger `seb://quit`.
    *   Enable reload button: Optional. The `/seb/live-test` page in your app has a placeholder for this.

7.  **Exam Tab**:
    *   Enable "Use Browser Exam Key" and "Use Config Key" and enter the generated keys if you are validating them on your server or client.
    *   "Send Browser Exam Key in HTTP header": Enable if your server expects it.
    *   "Send Config Key in HTTP header": Enable if your server expects it.

**IMPORTANT DEPLOYMENT NOTES FOR `exam-config.seb`:**

*   **Location**: This actual `exam-config.seb` file (created with the SEB Configuration Tool) must be placed in your project's `public/configs/` directory.
*   **Deployment**: Ensure your deployment provider (e.g., Netlify) serves this `.seb` file correctly.
    *   It MUST be served with a `Content-Type` of `application/seb` or `application/octet-stream`.
    *   It should NOT be served as an HTML page (e.g., your app's 404 page).
    *   You might need to configure custom headers in your hosting provider's settings (e.g., in `netlify.toml` for Netlify).
      Example `netlify.toml` rule:
      ```toml
      [[headers]]
        for = "/configs/*.seb"
        [headers.values]
          Content-Type = "application/seb"
      ```

**Remember to replace `YOUR_APP_DOMAIN` with your actual domain (e.g., `proctorx.netlify.app`).**
This file is just an example. Use the SEB Configuration Tool for Windows or macOS to create and encrypt your final `exam-config.seb` file with these settings.
