This is an EXAMPLE of settings for your exam-config.seb file.
You MUST create this file using the SEB Configuration Tool.
Save the actual .seb file as /public/configs/exam-config.seb

Key Settings to Configure in SEB Configuration Tool:

1. General > Start URL:
   Set this to: YOUR_APP_DOMAIN/seb/exam-view
   Replace YOUR_APP_DOMAIN with your actual application's domain (e.g., https://proctorx.netlify.app).
   IMPORTANT: The /seb/exam-view page will expect examId and token to be passed in the hash (#) of the Start URL.
   The application will construct the full configUrl for SEB like:
   https://YOUR_APP_DOMAIN/configs/exam-config.seb#examId=THE_EXAM_ID&token=THE_ENCRYPTED_TOKEN

2. General > Quit Link:
   Set to: seb://quit
   Ensure "Enable quit link" is checked.

3. Config File > Use "Starting an exam" settings.

4. Browser > Browser User Agent:
   Ensure "Append SEB version and OS info to User Agent" is CHECKED.
   Optionally, you can customize the user agent string if needed for stricter checks, but appending is usually sufficient.

5. Browser > Plug-Ins / Embeds:
   - Disable Java, Silverlight, Flash (unless specifically needed, which is rare).
   - Enable "Embed PDF files".

6. Browser > Security:
   - Enable "Block pop-up windows".
   - Enable "Block any file download/upload dialogs" (unless your exam specifically requires uploads handled by SEB, not by JavaScript `input[type=file]`).
   - Enable "Block content/plugins identified as potentially unsafe".

7. Exam > Security:
   - Enable "Enable screen capture protection" (if available and desired).
   - Enable "Prevent quitting SEB" (during the exam).
   - Enable "Enable detection of virtual machines".
   - Enable "Enable detection of screen sharing / remote desktop".

8. Applications > Permitted Processes:
   - Typically, you want to restrict this significantly. Add any essential helper applications ONLY if absolutely necessary (e.g., specific PDF viewers if not embedded).
   - For maximum security, allow no other processes or ensure SEB is set to "Create new desktop & hide taskbar".

9. Network > URL Filtering:
   - This is crucial.
   - Action for prohibited URLs: "Block URL and show warning".
   - Add rules to ALLOW your application domain (YOUR_APP_DOMAIN).
     Example: `https://YOUR_APP_DOMAIN/*` (Action: Allow)
   - Add rules to ALLOW Supabase URLs if your app makes direct client-side calls (for auth, storage, database if not proxied).
     Example: `https://*.supabase.co/*` (Action: Allow)
     Example: `wss://*.supabase.co/*` (Action: Allow for real-time)
   - Add rules to ALLOW DiceBear if using it for avatars.
     Example: `https://api.dicebear.com/*` (Action: Allow)
   - Block other URLs by default or add specific block rules.

10. User Interface > Browser Toolbar / Elements:
    - Hide Address Bar, Back/Forward buttons, Reload button (your app provides a refresh if needed).
    - Consider showing a minimal status bar or time.
    - Your application will provide its own "Exit SEB" button logic before the exam starts and after it ends.

11. Security > Browser Exam Key / Config Key:
    - Generate and use a Browser Exam Key.
    - Generate and use a Config Key.
    - These keys are sent in HTTP headers, and your server-side (if you had one for exam content delivery) would validate them. For a client-side only app, this primarily helps ensure the SEB instance is configured with your specific file.

12. Down/Uploads > File Handling:
    - Configure as needed if your exam involves file uploads/downloads managed by SEB.

IMPORTANT for Placeholders in Start URL (if your SEB version supports it, usually for SEB Server integration):
Some SEB versions allow query parameters in the Start URL like:
`YOUR_APP_DOMAIN/seb/exam-view?examId={examIdPlaceholder}&token={tokenPlaceholder}`
If so, the values from the `configUrl`'s hash might be accessible to SEB to fill these.
However, the most reliable cross-version method is for the `initiate` page to generate the full `configUrl` including the hash, and for `/seb/exam-view` to parse `window.location.hash`.

Test thoroughly with your SEB version!
The settings above are general recommendations.
