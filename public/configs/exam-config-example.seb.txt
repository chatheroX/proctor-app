CRITICAL TEST: Before proceeding, open https://YOUR_APP_DOMAIN/configs/exam-config.seb in a regular web browser (replace YOUR_APP_DOMAIN). It MUST download the exam-config.seb file. If it shows your website's 404 page, login page, or any other HTML, your Netlify (or other hosting provider) serving configuration for this file is incorrect and SEB will fail. Ensure your hosting provider serves this file with Content-Type: application/octet-stream or application/x-seb.

This is an EXAMPLE configuration text. You MUST use the Safe Exam Browser (SEB) Configuration Tool
to create your actual 'exam-config.seb' file and place it in /public/configs/exam-config.seb

Key Settings to Configure in SEB Configuration Tool:

1. General Tab:
   - Start URL:
     - Set this to: https://YOUR_APP_DOMAIN/seb/entry
     - Replace YOUR_APP_DOMAIN with your actual deployed application domain (e.g., https://proctorx.netlify.app).
     - DO NOT include any query parameters or hash parameters like #entryToken= here. The token will be passed by the application when it launches SEB.

2. Config File Tab:
   - Administration: Set a password for changing settings.
   - Encryption: Consider using a password to encrypt the .seb settings if distributing it.

3. Browser Tab:
   - Enable "Enable JavaScript".
   - Enable "Enable plug-ins (Flash, Java, etc.)" - generally NO, unless specifically needed.
   - Enable "Block pop-up windows" - typically YES.
   - What SEB should do with downloaded files: "Open/save them outside SEB" or "Block". For exams, usually "Block".

4. Exam Tab:
   - Enable quit link: seb://quit
   - Allow user to quit SEB: "Only after exam is submitted" or "Using quit password" or both.
   - Quit password: (Set one if you enable this option).

5. Network Tab > URL Filter:
   - This section is less critical if using the token-based entry (/seb/entry) as the page itself validates the token.
   - However, you might want to allow your domain:
     - Action: Allow, Expression: https://YOUR_APP_DOMAIN/*
   - And potentially deny everything else if you want to be very strict:
     - Action: Block, Expression: * (This should be the last rule)

6. Applications Tab > Prohibited Processes:
   - Add common screen sharing, remote control, communication apps (e.g., Zoom, Teams, Discord, AnyDesk, TeamViewer, OBS).
   - Add common screenshot/screen recording tools.

7. Browser Exam Key / Config Key:
   - The fields for Browser Exam Key and Config Key are on the "Exam" tab or "Config File" tab depending on SEB version.
   - These are generated by SEB when you save the config. Your application doesn't typically need to *send* these, but SEB uses them to verify the integrity of the session.
   - If your LMS or exam system requires your web application to *verify* these keys from SEB's request headers, you'd need server-side logic to read `X-SafeExamBrowser-RequestHash` (for ConfigKey) or `X-SafeExamBrowser-BrowserExamKey`. This is an advanced setup.

8. Security Tab:
   - Enable "Allow screen sharing (Screen Mirroring)" - typically NO.
   - Enable "Allow screen capture" - typically NO.
   - Enable "Allow virtual machine" - typically NO.
   - Enable "Allow Developer Tools" - NO.

Remember to SAVE your configuration from the SEB Configuration Tool as 'exam-config.seb' and place it in /public/configs/exam-config.seb in your project.
Your web application will then launch SEB by pointing to this .seb file, and SEB will use the "Start URL" defined within this file.
The application passes the entryToken as a hash parameter to the URL of the .seb file itself, e.g.,
https://YOUR_APP_DOMAIN/configs/exam-config.seb#entryToken=GENERATED_TOKEN
SEB should append this hash to the Start URL it loads from within the .seb file.
e.g., SEB should open: https://YOUR_APP_DOMAIN/seb/entry#entryToken=GENERATED_TOKEN
